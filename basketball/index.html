	  <h2>Spotlight: Kevin Durant</h2>

	  <h4>Kevin Durant is my GOAT. I have been watching KD for as long as i can remember. He has always been by favortie player growing up becasue of his ablity to score
	  and his abilty to create open looks for himself and his teamates. I've always tried to take after his game and play like him(thats why no one can guard me).</h4>
